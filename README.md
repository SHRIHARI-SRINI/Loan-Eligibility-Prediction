## Features
GUI Interface: The application provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for users to input relevant data for loan eligibility prediction.

Machine Learning Model: The prediction is powered by a Logistic Regression model trained on historical loan data.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt.
Installation

## Clone the repository
[git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-eligibility-prediction.git](https://github.com/SHRIHARI-SRINI/Loan-Eligibility-Prediction.git)

## Navigate to the project directory
cd loan-eligibility-prediction

## Run the application
python app.py

python app.py
Use the GUI to input the necessary details and get loan eligibility predictions.

## Important Note
The project uses a machine learning model serialized with joblib. Ensure to have the required version of scikit-learn when loading the model.

If you encounter issues related to model version inconsistency, refer to Scikit-learn Model Persistence.
